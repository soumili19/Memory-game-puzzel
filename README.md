# Memory-game-puzzel
A memory game puzzle is a Python project that challenges players to test and improve their memory skills. The game typically involves a grid of cards or tiles, each displaying a hidden image or symbol. Players must flip over pairs of cards to find matching pairs, with the goal of revealing all the pairs in the fewest number of moves.
